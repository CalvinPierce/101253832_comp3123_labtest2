Lab Test 2

This lab test takes an axios response from openweathermap api for the city of Toronto
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Toronto&appid={{APIkey}}

With the response we record the City name, temperature, date and time,, what the temperature feels like, the wind speed, and finally the weather icon
